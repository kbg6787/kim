### Working Paper
* "Do Scholarships Influence More Than One? Sibling Spillover Effects in College Scholarship" [project link](https://gpl.gsu.edu/project/sibling-spillover-effects-of-georgias-hope-scholarship/)
  <details><summary> Abstract </summary> With rising concerns on college affordability, numerous policies aim to provide financial aid to support students in their postsecondary education. While existing studies have examined the direct impact of financial aid on targeted student’s college enrollment, less is known about the broader spillover effects of these scholarships beyond the recipients. This paper investigates how college scholarships influence recipients’ siblings, who share household educational resources and serve as closer peer influences. Using student-level administrative data from public school districts in Atlanta and employing a regression discontinuity design, I estimate the effect of an older sibling receiving Georgia’s HOPE scholarship on the college enrollment of their younger sibling. The potential multiplier effect from financial aid beyond their intended beneficiaries helps policy makers to estimate the comprehensive impact of college access interventions.</details>
  
* "Gun Violence in Schools and Teacher Mobility"
  <details><summary> Abstract </summary> Teacher shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, make it crucial to understand the factors influencing teachers' decisions to stay or leave the profession for effective education policy. In this study, I examine the impact of school shootings on teacher mobility and retention with teacher-level employment data from North Carolina Public Schools covering from SY1995 to SY2023. To distinguish the causal impacts of in-school shootings from other potential determinants of teacher’s decision, I use an event study framework, taking advantage of randomness in the location and timing of shootings. Preliminary results indicate that teachers in schools exposed to shootings are more likely to leave the school in the subsequent school year. Future analysis will include the year-by-year trends of the teacher mobility in shooting exposed schools, and heterogenous analysis on different characteristics of the teachers.</details>
